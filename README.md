## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v20 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd nuclear-station-newsletter
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. The server will automatically find an available port starting from 5000. Watch the console output for the actual port number, then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:[PORT]
```

The server includes a health check endpoint at `/health` to verify the application status.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
PORT=5000                    # Preferred starting port (optional, defaults to 5000)
NODE_ENV=development        # Application environment
```

Note: If the specified port is in use, the server will automatically try the next available port up to PORT+10.
